# FL511 Video-Incident Correlation System Status

*Last Updated: 2025-08-28 18:41 PST*

## ✅ **COMPLETED COMPONENTS**

### Database Infrastructure
- **✅ Clean Schema**: Comprehensive 4-table design with correlation function
- **✅ All Cameras Loaded**: 776 cameras (224 I-4, 552 I-95) with geolocation data
- **✅ Indexes & Views**: Optimized for spatial-temporal queries
- **✅ Documentation**: Complete schema documentation and migration history

### Video Capture System
- **✅ Authentication Pipeline**: 6-step FL511 video auth working correctly
- **✅ Video Storage**: Segments uploading to Cloud Storage successfully  
- **✅ Single Camera Test**: Verified end-to-end capture for camera 2242
- **✅ 10-Camera Test**: Scaled to 10 cameras with no SSL errors
- **✅ Cloud Storage**: Video segments properly organized by camera/date

## ⚠️  **ISSUES IDENTIFIED**

### 1. Incident Database Storage
- **Status**: 🔴 **BROKEN**
- **Issue**: Incidents scraped from FL511 API but not stored in database
- **Impact**: No incident-video correlation possible
- **Root Cause**: Database insertion code in video capture service not working

### 2. Automated Incident Polling  
- **Status**: 🔴 **NOT CONFIGURED**
- **Issue**: No Cloud Scheduler jobs running
- **Impact**: Manual incident scraping only
- **Expected**: Every 5 minutes automated polling

### 3. Video Segment Metadata Storage
- **Status**: 🔴 **BROKEN** 
- **Issue**: `store_video_segments_metadata` method missing in deployed service
- **Impact**: Video segments in Cloud Storage but not in database
- **Root Cause**: Deployment didn't pick up latest code changes

## 📊 **CURRENT DATA STATUS**

```
Database Contents:
├── cameras: 776 records (✅ COMPLETE)
├── incidents: 1 record (❌ ONLY TEST DATA) 
├── video_segments: 2 records (❌ ONLY TEST DATA)
└── correlations: 2 records (❌ ONLY TEST DATA)

Cloud Storage:
├── Video segments: ~50+ files (✅ ACTIVELY COLLECTING)
├── Multiple cameras: 2242, 2243, 2327, 2328, etc.
└── Date organized: camera_XXXX/YYYYMMDD/filename.ts
```

## 🔧 **REQUIRED FIXES**

### Priority 1: Fix Incident Storage
```bash
# Problem: Incidents not inserting to database
# Solution: Fix database connection in scrape_incidents endpoint
# File: video_capture_service.py:scrape_incidents()
```

### Priority 2: Deploy Missing Metadata Storage
```bash
# Problem: store_video_segments_metadata method missing
# Solution: Redeploy service with latest code
# Command: gcloud builds submit && ./redeploy_service.sh
```

### Priority 3: Enable Automated Polling
```bash
# Problem: No Cloud Scheduler jobs configured  
# Solution: Create incident polling job
# Command: ./deploy_i4_i95_capture.sh (scheduler section)
```

## 🎯 **NEXT STEPS**

### Immediate (< 1 hour)
1. **Fix incident database insertion** - Debug and repair scrape_incidents endpoint
2. **Redeploy video capture service** - Include missing metadata storage method  
3. **Load recent incidents** - Backfill database with FL511 data

### Short Term (< 1 day)  
1. **Setup automated polling** - Configure Cloud Scheduler for 5-minute incident checks
2. **Enable correlation** - Run correlation function with real data
3. **Monitoring setup** - Create health checks for data pipeline

### Long Term (< 1 week)
1. **Scale video capture** - Increase from 10 to 50+ cameras
2. **Performance tuning** - Optimize database queries for large datasets
3. **Alerting system** - Notification when incidents lack video coverage

## 🔍 **TESTING VERIFICATION**

### Working Components
- ✅ Camera database queries
- ✅ Video capture authentication  
- ✅ Cloud Storage uploads
- ✅ Correlation algorithm (with test data)

### Broken Components  
- ❌ Incident scraping to database
- ❌ Video segment metadata to database
- ❌ Automated scheduling
- ❌ Real-time correlation

## 📈 **SUCCESS METRICS** 

When system is fully operational:
- **Incidents/hour**: ~20-30 from FL511 API
- **Video segments/hour**: ~180 (10 cameras × 3 segments × 6 captures)  
- **Correlation rate**: >80% incidents with video evidence
- **Data freshness**: <5 minutes lag for incident detection

## 🚨 **CURRENT LIMITATIONS**

1. **Manual Operation Only** - No automated incident/video correlation
2. **Limited Camera Coverage** - Only 10 of 776 cameras actively capturing
3. **No Real-time Alerts** - Cannot detect new incidents automatically
4. **Missing Historical Data** - Only test correlations exist

*This system has solid architecture and most components working. Main issues are deployment/configuration related, not fundamental design problems.*
